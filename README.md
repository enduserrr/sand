# Sand - Learning Repository

This repository serves as a sandbox for my ongoing learning journey in programming and software development. 
It contains a variety of projects, exercises, and experiments to look back on my learning juorney.

## Projects

- libft: Recreating a number of basic C functions.
- get_next_line: A function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.
- ft_printf: Creating a mini printf.



I apologize for any confusion. After reviewing the instructions provided, I realize there is no explicit mention of how the program should handle empty arguments such as "". My previous statement was an interpretation based on common error handling practices and the expectation that the program should indicate when it encounters invalid input.

Given the absence of explicit guidance in the instructions regarding how to handle empty arguments, you may interpret and implement this aspect according to your discretion. It's a common practice to provide informative error messages for invalid input to assist users in understanding why their input was rejected.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with a specific aspect of your implementation, feel free to ask!
