 # FRACT-OL

 ## WHAT ARE FRACTALS
 A fractal is an abstract mathematical geometric shape. Fractals can exhibit self-similarity and complexity across different scales, meaning that the patterns in fractals repeat with variations at different scales. (This variation in detail and complexity is a defining characteristic of fractals and distinguishes them from simpler geometric objects like curves or surfaces.)
 Fractals are characterised by the possibility of fractional dimensions (non integer) as their dimensions can be any real number. Meaning the relationship between mass and volume in fractals isn't linear like with objects with integer dimensions.

## MULTITHREADING
The pthread.h library in C is used for multithreading programming. It provides a set of functions and data types for creating and managing threads within a C program.

Threads are lightweight processes that can execute independently within a program, allowing for concurrent execution of multiple tasks. The pthread.h library allows you to create, join, and synchronize threads, as well as manage thread attributes and handle thread-specific data.

Using pthreads, you can write C programs that take advantage of parallelism to improve performance, handle multiple tasks simultaneously, or utilize resources more efficiently. This is particularly useful in applications such as servers, real-time systems, and computation-intensive tasks where concurrency is beneficial.
