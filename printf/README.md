FT_PRINTF

In this project the goal was to write a library containing ft_printf(), a function mimicking the original printf() without implementing its buffer management. The function should handle conversions: cspdiuxX%.printf() function in C. This project introduced me to variadic functions. 

Passed my own testing as well as the francinette --strict tests.
